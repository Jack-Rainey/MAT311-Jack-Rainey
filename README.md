## Notes
- Every Markdown and code cell after this was generated by ChatGPT 5 Extended Thinking. The only exception to this is that I needed to seperate certian merged sections of Python code into multiple cells for readability of the graphs.
- You can read my full conversation here if you would like: https://chatgpt.com/share/68f98977-3038-8005-b1d9-02f582f1d495
  - Note that there is some 2/2 prompts in there. That is because I forgot some important context that the LLM would need that I didn't realize I forgot until it gave its output.
  - There's also far more information in the actual conversation than my summaries below becuase while it woked most of the time, I

## Important Prompts (Summarized and Reworded)
1. In the following prompts, I'm going to ask you to generate a report on the provided Kaggle dataset. Assume the dataset is saved in "card_transdata.csv".
2. First, create is a section titled "Data Context," which explains what the dataset is. Please include a table with the features and an explanation of what each feature means.
3. Next, you need to load the libraries.
4. Next, load the CSV file as well as print the head, shape, info, and describe of the data.
5. Next, generate a data wrangling section. First, print the sum for each column that is null. Then I want you to create a new DataFrame variable that is simply the old one, but with the NAs dropped. Then print the shape and head of this new dataset.
6. Next, visualize the data. Generate the following graphs:
   1. A countplot for the feature fraud with the title "Fraud Class Distribution".
   2. Same countplot idea as before, but for the "used_pin_number" feature.
   3. Same thing again, but for "online_orders".
   4. Same thing again, but for "repeat_retailer".
   5. A histogram comparing the"ratio_to_median_purchase_price" distribution and the title "Ratio to Median Purchase Price Distribution".
   6. Same histogram idea as before, but for "distance_from_home".
7. Next, make bivariate visualizations. Add a hue for the "fraud" feature with colors red for fraudulent and green for non-fraudulent. The graphs are:
   1. A countplot for "used_pin_number" with the title "Transactions with PIN vs Fraudulent Transactions". Also, make a percentage plot based on whether or not the PIN was used from "used_pin_number".
   2. A countplot similar to the one mentioned for "used_pin_number" but for "used_chip". Also, make the appropriate percentage plot for this one as well.
   3. The appropriate countplot and percentage plots similar to the ones mentioned before, but for "online_order".
   4. A scatterplot of the breakdown of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions for "distance_from_last_transaction" vs "ratio_to_median_purchase_price".
   5. A scatterplot similar to the one I just mentioned, but for "distance_from_home" and "ratio_to_median_purchase_price".
